1. Swapping the register content:
   Write a program to swap the content of two registers (you have to
   chose any two general purpose registers from $t0 to $t7, $s0 to $s7, $t8 to $t9) using the following methods:
    - Using third intermediate register but without using anymoveinstructions (think if you can
      use add instruction to move data).
    - Without using third temporary register and using only the addition and subtraction instructions.
    - Without using third temporary register and without using addition and subtraction instruction

2. Play with polynomial: 
   Write a program using only the arithmetic and logic instruction set to
   compute the following polynomial: ax^2 −bx+cwhere value for a, b, c, and x can be any positive
   integer number.

3. Doing without:
    - Write a program to multiply two numbersaandbusing only the shift instructions. Assume
       that one of the number is either 2, 4, or 8. Write two version program where in the first one
       you use the register addressing mode (i.e R type instruction format) and in the second one
       you use immediate addressing mode (i.e I type instruction format).
    - Write a program to perform division operation onaas dividend andbas divisor using shift in-
       structions assuming that the dividend is either 2, 4, or 8. Check (manually) for what value ofa
       you obtain the exact division results.

4. The Simple Logic:
   Write a program or a set of programs to implement the bit-wise logical operations: AND, OR,
   XOR, XNOR, AND Masking, Or Masking, Reset to zero with XOR, one’s complement, (try write
   2’s complement but don’t use add instruction).
